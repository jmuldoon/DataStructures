Data Structures
=====

As suggested by a friend, I have implemented the following data structures, SLL, DLL, SLQueue, and uploaded them. My original intention was to make them as modular as possible, so when doing them in C++ I used templates in order to fit a variety of data type needs. If you have suggestions, please feel free to comment or send me a message.
